#Quick start with design by contract

= Introduction =
We explain how to use Design by contract using JavaDbC library from Eclipse IDE. 
You need the following dependencies in your classPath

 #javaDbc.jar
 #aspectjweaver.jar 
 #ognl.jar
 #log4j.jar
 #junit.jar

You need to use Java5 o later. 

== Envairoment SetUp ==
Eclipse IDE 3.x, in this case I'm using Eclipse 3.3 (Europe Version).

Start a new java project
create the following directories

 src\ (java classes)
 lib\ (Third party libraries)  
 test\ (test cases)   

Then you need to create the following class

== Write Preconditions ==

== Write Postconditions ==

== Write Invariants ==

(Put the examples, and create a test to show how this work)


== Test the examples ==
(Show how you can check contract violations)


== Using AspectJ Eclipse IDE ==
(Show how you can see which methods the DbC (Aspect) are intercepting)
